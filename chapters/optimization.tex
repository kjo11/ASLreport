Some notes on the optimization

Why add bending energy as regularizer? Because when there are not many measurements, the hessian Matrix (A'A) would be singular and not invertible. 
(Which is a problem when trying to solve b = (A'A)A'x.
The bending energy further offers the advantage over other choices that it leads to a smooth transition between well-populated regions if their 
in between is not well populated (as opposed to other choices that would tune the "in between" to zero instead).
